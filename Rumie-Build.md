This document will provide you with details on **Rumie-Build**, and specifications and parameters associated with the operation of the application.

**Introduction:**
Rumie is a technology company but also a charity, on a mission to create opportunities for a better quality of life through learning. The Rumie Platform reflects Rumie's unique technology solutions to bridge the learning and skills gap for learners around the world. 

**Scope:**
The Rumie platform is a multifaceted enterprise level technology platform that forms the essential digital toolkit to author, curate and distribute Rumie microlearning courses known as “Bytes”. The platform is made up of three distinct but connected cloud-based web applications named **Rumie-Build**, **Rumie-Connect** and **Rumie-Learn**.

**Summary:**

Rumie-Build is a cloud application that facilitates an introduction to microlearning, and the creation of digital microlearning courses (“Bytes”) by volunteer subject matter experts. Through this platform, stakeholders are able to create and publish their own private Bytes and also publish these Bytes onto [<u>Rumie-Learn</u>](https://learn.rumie.org/) (*subject to Rumie approval) for learners across the globe to access, interact with, and provide feedback on.

Rumie-Build provides a full array of digital authoring tools and a platform for volunteers to create Bytes on a broad range of topics and categories, based on their individual skills and expertise. These Bytes can be created independently on their own time, or through a virtual workshop experience that facilitates collaborative realtime authoring within a team format.

The application also provides the capability to integrate interactive quizzes, add fun facts and also to populate the Bytes with a wide array of digital media like audio, video, embeds, images, memes, gifs. These digital integrations live within a proprietary WYSIWYG editor, providing an intuitive and easy experience for the authors to create their own Bytes.

Rumie-Build also can serve as a standalone Learning Experience Solution. It supports the ability to curate and assemble Bytes into linear learning courses, and the ability to distribute these courses to specific learner audiences. These courses can be made available to a select group of learners for purposes such as onboarding, and training and development. As learners interact with these private courses and the individual Bytes that are part of the course, data is collected about the learner engagement and completion of the Bytes, and aggregated from all learners on the specific course. This data is available to course creators and administrators for the purposes of understanding efficacy and improving the courses and Bytes.
