Rumie is a learning technology nonprofit organization, located in Toronto, Canada, that reduces barriers to learning by creating free micro-learning courses, Bytes<sup>tm</sup>. Rumie provides the tools and a platform for volunteers to build Bytes covering a broad range of topics, based on their skills and expertise. Our aim is to empower communities globally, so inevitably, biases are formed due to differences in culture, location and expertise. Being mindful that the content and resources made available by Rumie is the collective work of our volunteers, partners and the team, we try our best to guide contributions that are culturally sensitive and aware. As a small organization, we provide the tools and technology for learners and trust that individuals will self-curate and determine what the most relevant, no-cost content is for them.

## Standards

1. may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal;

3. seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise;
4. may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort;

6. contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party's trade secrets);
