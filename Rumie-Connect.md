**Introduction:**
Rumie is a technology company but also a charity, on a mission to create opportunities for a better quality of life through learning. The Rumie Platform reflects Rumie's unique technology solutions to bridge the learning and skills gap for learners around the world. 

**Scope:**
The Rumie platform is a multifaceted enterprise level technology platform that forms the essential digital toolkit to author, curate and distribute Rumie microlearning courses known as “Bytes”. The platform is made up of three distinct but connected cloud-based web applications named **Rumie-Build**, **Rumie-Connect** and **Rumie-Learn**.

**Product Summary**

Rumie-Connect is a web based cloud application that offers the ability to create unique Rumie-Learn experiences aligned to the needs of a specific audience group, and to publish these experiences associated with a unique Rumie-Learn URL. It allows the distribution of Bytes and the Rumie-Learn library to these custom audiences, with curation capabilities based on specific learning needs, and the partitioning of analytics and engagement data associated to specific audience segments.

The application provides stakeholders with the ability to navigate the different categories/topics/themes of available Bytes, and to influence the Byte categories being shown to learners in their specific experience. It also allows the stakeholder to access a full analytics dashboard on the sources and number, as well as full engagement metrics on the learners that have accessed their experience.
