Created by Manav Chugh on Aug 05, 2020 The Rumie Initiative

This document will provide you with details on the Rumie-Connect, specifications and parameters associated with the operation of the platform.

**Introduction**:

The Rumie Platform reflects Rumie's newest solution for partners, expanding beyond traditional Rumie tablets and learning libraries to more versatile technology options that bring improved functionality to multiple devices, computers, laptops, desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

This solution will continue to bridge the learning and skills gap for learners around the world.

Rumie platform software includes three products: **Build**, **Connect** and **Learn**, that form an ecosystem that serves one main goal: to empower the best and most timely elearning experience for learners.

**Product Summary**

Rumie-Connect is a web, cloud application that offers the ability to create unique projects that allows the distribution of Rumie Bytes and the Rumie-Learn platform to custom audiences, based on the desired customization criteria. It will allow stakeholders to create and configure customized Rumie-Learn projects, influence the category areas of the Bytes that will be delivered for these specific projects to define which learners these projects will be delivered to, and ultimately deploy the projects by sharing the generated Rumie-Learn project URL, directly with the learners.

This will help in targeting a specific learner group/audience and provide them with curated and specific microlearning courses (Bytes) to interact and access via Rumie-Learn.

The application provides the stakeholders with the ability to gain awareness of the different categories/topics/ themes of Bytes, that are available, and so that they can influence the Bytes being delivered via Rumie-Learn and populate the platform with the categories that will provide the most value to the learner audience for whom they have created the project for.
